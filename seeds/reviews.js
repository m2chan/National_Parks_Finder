    'Acadia': [{ body: "What an incredible park to visit with the family. The Jordan Pond Trailhead, Bubble Rock, Cadillac Mountain, Thunder Hole, Flying Mountain, and the Bar Harbor area. So many things to do and see with the family. Make sure Acadia is on you National Park list of must visit parks with the family.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Acadia is a must see if you are visiting Maine. There is so much to explore around the park. Most hikes up to the mountains are relatively hard and somewhat risky but the views are really nice. I would highly recommend visiting in the summer and visiting the west side of the park due to the beautiful views of the islands and water ways. It is a national treasure and a beautiful vacation spot. Hopefully you all get great views and weather.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Due to Covid-19 my travel plans shifted to mainly outdoors adventures. This is an amazing park. Must see, especially during the fall to take in all the colors! Would make a great family trip.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Awesome park. Free access in the winter. Amazing views of the ocean from the forest!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Vacationed in Acadia (and Bar Harbor) in lieu of Hawaii this year because of the pandemic. While the two locations differ greatly, Acadia did not disappoint. From watching the sunrise from atop Cadillac Mountain, to hiking Great Head trail to listening to the waves crash at Little Hunter's Beach to hiking along Jordan Pond and up to Bubble Rock, there was so much to see and do here. We had a great time. Another thing we did here was taking a horse drawn carriage ride through the woods, enjoying nature and learning a thing or two along the way. The park is open 24 hours a day, which comes in handy if you want to go in and see the stars or watch the sunrise. The admission fee of $27 for the car is a good deal. The park is absolutely beautiful. The bottom line; This was a great trip and was filled with many cool memories of some really good times... We were here for the better part of a week, but there were many other things we could have done. Perhaps next time!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Hiked the Beech Cliff Trail to the summit and back. Definitely involves a bunch of climbing on precarious rocks and 3 ladder climbs so be sure you can handle it. The view is amazing and worth it. Had a swing around Echo beach and ended up around Jordan Pond at Jordan Pond House for lunch. Its busy despite low tourist season so no idea what peak looks like. Weather was perfect. Park rangers are helpful and everyone is working on wearing masks and distancing. We saw very few people on our trail but Jordan Pond House was pretty busy... Lots of outdoor lawn to sit out and enjoy your meals. Not sure what the fuss is over the popovers. I didn't think it was a big deal. Loved sitting at Jordan Pond and soaking in the peace. Highly recommend a visit to Acadia! You won't be disappointed.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "I can't plan a trip back here fast enough! Love the town of Acadia, love the scenic park. Was the perfect visit for both beginner and novice hiking.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This park is truly the most beautiful in the country. There are currently very few travelers as Maine is handling the pandemic well. Everyone must test negative within 72 hours of arriving. The only crowds were at the expected locations and so thin that it was still easy to socially distance.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Much like Hawaii - almost every time you turn a corner you're blessed with a new, amazing view. We will 100% be coming back, there's a little of something for everyone as far as trails go!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "If you like nature, hiking, ocean, lakes and small quaint towns then Acadia National Park is the place to visit. Unless you like oodles of people avoid the 4th of July weekend which has become very crowded over the years. It is lots of fun on the 4th but super crowded. Otherwise there is great hiking, great food and swimming over the whole island. Also great local artisans and crafts available. Enjoy!!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "The best National Park! One of the prettiest places on the planet! Great drive up to Cadillac Mountain, great hike around Jordan Pond and THUNDER HOLE!!! Highly recommend all humans visit here at some point in their life!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "My husband and I went here while in Maine on our honeymoon. The park is beautiful with many hikes and beautiful scenery. We hiked saw Thunder Hole and hiked the Precipitous Trail- and trail was a vertical rock climb straight up. One of the toughest hikes/climbs, but so worth it!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "What an incredible and magical place! This is my second trip in under ten years and I hope to come back again next year. The unspoiled beauty of the Atlantic Coastline is so majestic. There are trails for everyone’s challenge and ability level all with spectacular views of the ocean. Sandy Beach, Cadillac Mountain and Otter Cliffs were especially beautiful.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "If you are looking for a beautiful view then the sunrise in Acadia will take your breath away. I have packed into many glorious back country spots. I have drove on a wide variety of roads full of stunning views. I have sat on the peaks of many mountains and watched the Sun Rise and Sun Fall. There has been many trails that literally and metaphorically took my breath away. Yet, this terrain that only sits between 16 feet to the tallest point at 1,560 feet in elevation (Cadillac Mountain), some how manages to compete with the scenery of the West. It is beyond beautiful.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This is such a beautiful park! The rugged coastline found in Acadia National Park and along the coast of Maine is truly breathtaking. If you ever get the chance I would recommend you visit this park.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This park is a dream! A little bit of a journey to get there but so very worth it. It’s huge so I barely got to scratch the surface but loved every minute of it, and I’m already planning a trip back to tackle the rest. Sand beach was great! The coast trail was perfect. Going to Acadia was a bucket list item and it will be a bucket list item now to get back! Must see this place in its entirety. Unlike any other national park I’ve experienced! And soooo very well kept by the park rangers. Mad props, people! Love this one! Would give it 100 stars if I could!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Acadia National Park is a wonderful scenic park that you can drive through with multiple park spaces to park and take pictures and enjoy the views. There are also various hiking trails and multiple loops you can take whether you prefer a shorter or longer drive around. There is a Parker ranger at the entrance that can provide a map and your driving pass throughout the park unless you prefer to walk through the park, at a lower cost. My recommendation is to give yourself at least an hour and a half to drive through the park and make pit stops on the many scenic overlooks.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "If you are visiting national parks, this one should be tops on your list. You get to experience Maine's gorgeous coast and rugged mountain terrain all inside and outside of the park. Walk or ride the carriage trails or park and relax at Sand Beach. Make it a point to be the 1st in the United States to see the sunrise atop Cadillac Mountain. Regardless of the social distancing factors involved, officials at ANP are there to make sure your experience in Acadia is a trip that will last a lifetime.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This park is a part of huge Harbor area with beautiful islands, terrific Atlantic ocean and so attractive ponds. You can spend unforgettable vacation herBoae as million Americans. Boating, kayaking, hiking, riding - it is up to you. And touch the old history of America.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Pros: It's a NP with different landscapes combined. Cadillac Mountain sure has some nice views. The trail along the cliff has lots of nice view spots too. Cons: some of the climbing trails are not kids friendly. Some spots like Jordan Pond needs a lot more parking spots as people would park there and spend a few hours climbing, so if you don't get there as the first group, there is no chance to park there for a long time.", rating: 5 }],
    'American Samoa': [{ body: "National Park of American Samoa is an extraordinary exotic tropical park with a lot of scenic attractions for hiking, exploring and relaxing. Samoan atmosphere was pleasant and laid-back. Hiking on trail was ruggedness, especially on the mountain, but on the beach was easygoing and relax. It is safe to travel there, but bring a lot of drinking water and a walking stick for your safety and health because the climate is tropical hot, and occasionally rainshowers - be careful on slippery rocks - a walking stick is your true lifesaver. It was fun and challenging for this mountainous trail. Samoan people gladly welcomed our visitors to explore their fascinating islands.", rating: 4 },
    { body: "This place is simply an island paradise. Beautiful beaches and scenery everywhere you look. And the best part about it is, there are no crowds. We literally had some of the most pristine beaches and hikes entirely to ourselves. Plus part of the park is learning about the Samoan culture, which is great, as you are treated like family wherever you go. Just for comparison, we flew to Hawaii after American Samoa, and boy was Hawaii underwhelming after visiting this place. American Samoa spoiled me.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Recently spent a week in American Samoa, and visited the park headquarters twice. A small facility with good displays on what the park has available. I did a little hiking in the park as well, and there's a trail guide in the park headquarters and online. A few of the hikes listed in the online version are not currently available. NPS staff were friendly and accommodating.", rating: 5 }],
    'Arches': [{ body: "Spent the day at Arches National Park and was not disappointed. The park wasn't crowded and the scenic drive was a great way to see the park with a few stops and short hikes in between. The coolest arch was the sand dune arch which is hidden in this slot canyon filled with golden sand!", rating: 4 },
    { body: "One of the best national parks. Went here during winter. It was super chilly and the roads were closed one day due to winter storm. Must visit: Delicate arch, double arch There is small hike to the Delicate arch but worth a visit for sure. They have restrooms in the area but no food. I would recommend to carry some snacks if you want to visit all the destinations in one day.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Awesome place to see! If you have the chance, this national park is large and will take hours to see everything. Beautiful views!!! (The pictures I took are not nearly as good as seeing this place with your own eyes)", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Most spectacular place I've ever been in America. So beautiful and I enjoyed being there in off season. Less crowds and the snow was so pretty.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Entry fee: $35 (I suggest you buy an annual national park pass). Best national park in Utah. You need 2-3 days in this park to explore and do hikes according to your capability. The park has a lot to offer, hikes, camping, picnic areas, and junior ranger programs. We took 2 days with a two year old toddler. There are many hikes that you can easily do with a toddler. The windows, arches balanced rock, the delicate arch are some of the parks best attractions. The delicate arch trail is one of the most popular hikes and sadly we couldn’t do it because of snow and ice, the trail was closed.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Beautiful park! Definitely cold and snowy, but well worth the visit.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "I wanted to avoid the crowds so we arrived in late September, no such thing. Arches is busy all year. But the 2 days we spent in the park it rained on and off and we were on a Motorcycle. We were prepared with the right gear even in pouring downpours which scared away most people and delighted to see many waterfalls a rarity in the park.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Excellent place. It took 1 hr 20 minutes (including lots of small break :P) to reach delicate arch and it totally worth it... The last 15-20 minutes were extremely icy. Heavy boots are recommended...", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Amazingly beautiful place! Take the two hour round trip drive to the back of the park, or take a little longer and try some of the short hikes (we enjoyed the hike to the “Windows”). Park is well marked, with plenty of scenic viewpoints to pull over the car and take it all in.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This is my second visit to this park and it feels fresh like a new visit. I would suggest to take the hike route to delicate arch which is tiring and takes about 45-60 minutes to reach the arch but it is all worth it. The landscape arch is good too. If you are not physically fit for a hike then better visit landscape arch which involves walk for about 30 mins", rating: 4 },
    { body: "Place is extremely beautiful. Had a fantastic time with the family. My four year old daughter made the hike to delicate arch. It’s a nice sight. Family friendly and as clean as you can ask.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Get in touch with mother nature. Amazing wish we had more time to spend here. Always turn and look behind you. Be safe and dress for the occasion. Follow the rules.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Been wanting to visit this place for the longest time. The drive over was mainly uninspiring, but once inside? Awe inspiring. And I'm not easily impressed.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "From all the national parks I've visited (Arizona, South California, Nevada) Arches is my favorite by far. The contrast of this red soil and the snow is amazing. I highly recommend visiting it as early as possible in the day to enjoy the fog and frozen vegetation which make you think you are on a different planet.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This place is spectacular!!!!! So much parking and clean restrooms. All of the trails are clearly marked get your map at the entrance. Most of them are a quick hike but there are some challenging ones for the more experienced. We ended up doing 9 miles of walking/hiking. We had an amazing experience please bring sunblock, water and snacks. There is picnic tables and plenty of benches. Enjoy the spectacular views.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This is an amazing drive through the high desert with a lot of really awesome natural arches. Drive through at sunset and enjoy amazing skies and light hitting all the stone 😍. I would love to return with an RV and just enjoy some peace away from people. It’s quite secluded and away from things in SW Utah.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Utah is such an amazing place visit if you like national parks! We stopped at Arches, Capital Reef, and Canyonlands and each one was spectacular in its own way. Arches was amazing for the unique rock formations, and the arches as it's name suggested. The Fiery Furnace (permit required) is also tons of fun if you looking for even more adventure. Watching a sunset from Delicate Arch was probably the highlight of the trip and then staying even after sunset as the stars are absolutely amazing.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Great place!! Certainly get here early. The driving tour is amazing and it’s extremely easy to pull off along the road in the many provided alcoves to take pictures or park to start some hikes. Most wonders are just a short walk while some can be up to a couple miles. During winter bring crampons even if you don’t use. Many places were quite icy and I saw many people eat it haha. Otherwise a beautiful must see place.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Wonderful place! A lot of memories and a great place to spend time in family or group or even as a couple. You can spend hours in there. There are places to walk through, places to seat down and eat, few places with bathroom. I paid $30 to go in, in my opinion, it is expensive, and the park should consider to go down with their prices, but the visiting is really worth.", rating: 4 },
    { body: "This place deserves 10 stars. There were definitely not a lot of people around and honestly it was too cold, foggy to enjoy the driving but Arches was amazing. Bring yak tracks to be able to walk on icy trails. Lovely quaint town.", rating: 5 }],
    'Badlands': [{ body: "We did not know what to expect when we decided to go here. Man - what a unique place. So glad they have preserved it as a National Park. It so unique it is hard to describe - but well worth a trip to see it. The wildlife was fun too! We found a prairie dog town just off the main road and it was like watching one of the old Disney Nature movies.", rating: 4 },
    { body: "Such an amazing park. Lots to see. Stunning views, trails, and alot of places to climb. Don't miss the Sage Creek Road Loop. It is a nice level gravel dirt road with lots of wildlife to see and many great photo opportunities. It is a must see.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Love this park. I recommend walking some of the shorter trail at least like Notch Trail, Window, and Door Trail. Plus hit the overlooks especially at sunrise or sunset.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "One of the more underrated national parks. We saw much more wildlife here than expected! Definitely worth waking up and getting there early for a sunrise in the park!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "We visited the Badlands in September, and it was amazing. Words can not describe this National park is! My girls loved seeing the prairie dogs and bison. I recommend spending 2 days there. If you only have one day to spend, try to watch the sunset. It’s simply amazing. The Badlands is one of the most unique landscapes in the world. Gods creation is truly amazing.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Perfect getaway national park. Near a very small town called interior, mostly a ghost town. Quickest way is to use i90, best way is to take 44. There are some rough roads but even your sedan can handle them.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This place is a must go to if you are in the area. The scenery is stunning. I was amazed at the cluster of hills then miles of open space framed by these beauties. This place reminds me of a combination between The Painted Desert and the Canyonlands. Saw a sheep walking down the road that had not a care in the world. There are plenty of pull-outs to take photos and enjoy the beauty that mother nature bestows upon us.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Bright sun with cold breeze. I would suggest to stay in park if you want to enjoy the sky full of stars. Get your own food as food options are limited here. Good place for a 2 day trip.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "So majestic and awe inspiring! We drove the 31 mile loop and every sight was a sight to leave you speechless. If you are a rock climber you will love this opportunity to climb the rock face. It was a really joyful place.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Badlands National Park is the best place to start a road trip out West. The location is so unique and is something everyone would enjoy. The views are beautiful and so strange at the same time! Dress and prepare for hot weather because temperatures can reach 100 degrees. To fully experience the park, driving will not suffice. There are several short trails that can show you all you need to see. I’d probably recommend spending a couple hours here then proceed on the highway to Custer. This is a wonderful stop that one must see on the way out West!", rating: 4 },
    { body: "Amazing. Plenty of buffalo, long horned sheep, eagles and prairie dogs running around for visitors to see. The badlands scenery is amazing and you’ll personally feel the windswept nature of the place (step outside even in early fall and have the moisture stripped from your skin by the wind).", rating: 5 },
    { body: "We drove Sage Creek Road from Scenic all the way to Interior & enjoyed all the sights. Parts of the gravel road were like a washboard but not too bad. There were sufficient turnouts to stop without blocking traffic. Definitely a great place to see & explore!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Very cool and interesting to see the dramatically different and changing topography. Plenty of Bison and Prairie Dogs along the way too. Didn't get to see the South end of the park since the Lakota tribe closed it off due to Covid-19. Still a great drive through the rest of the park though.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Amazing place to visit. The views are amazing! I could spend a whole week in this place. Make sure to bring plenty of food and water.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Takes about and hour to drive through going speed limit but you will want to spend more time getting out of the car, going for how's and taking pictures. Be careful for snakes and bring water. They also recommend staying on trails to preserve the nature. Lots of dinosaur fossils have been and are being discovered here.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Pretty amazing! Please bring plenty of water, electrolytes and wear sunscreen. Plan your route ahead of time. The trails are not difficult. The drive is beautiful and scenic; get out of your car to optimize your enjoyment of the sights!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "It's amazing. One of its kind. Driving through this was fun. There are places you can find prairie dogs, big horn sheep, bisons etc. There are so many scenic points to click pictures and take a look at rocky mountains, land formations, steep canyons. We were there on a sunny day so would recommend travel with energy drinks, water, sunscreen, hat. Do stop your vehicle at various overlook points, it's beautiful ; The Fossil Exhibit Trail, Pinnacles Overlook, Yellow Mounds Overlook, White River Valley, Panorama Point etc.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "The Badlands is amazing. Worth seeing. I'd even venture to say its more worth it to see this than Mt. Rushmore. Truly amazing place. This last time was the first time I saw it in the snow, very pretty.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "It's an almost other-worldly experience. The landscape is incredible, the colors look painted on. I have taken as long trip through Glacier, Yellowstone, Grand Teton, MT Rushmore and the Badlands. After Glacier the Badlands were my most favorite. So beautiful. Something different to admire and hawk at at every corner. A brilliant natural phenomenon.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Just magical. Very similar to the Petrified Forest with the added bonus of so many amazing animals at your fingertips. Buffalo, Prairie Dogs, Long Horn Sheep just feet from you. We’ve spent 2 days here and could spend many more. So much to see. Beautiful views no matter where you look. Try to catch a sunset, so beautiful.", rating: 5 }],
    'Big Bend': [{ body: "The highlights of our trip were the Window hiking trail and the various primitive roads which we drove in our Jeep. However, I don't believe anything could be disappointing in Big Bend. There's not a bad view in the park!", rating: 4 },
    { body: "I loved the park! We hiked several trails, enjoyed all of them thoroughly. Two days are required to enjoy the park.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Beautiful park. We're lucky that we're able to reserve 2 night at chisos mountain campground. We hiked the window trail and the scenery are just amazing. At night time it was so quite at the campground and a nice place to stargaze. Not enough time to visit or hike other places. Will come back for sure.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Park Lanes to get in were long, expected due to demand; the balancing rock is amazing and the whole vast of choices that nature gives you to hike is endless.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Big Bend is simply amazing. A must see in Texas, in the USA, in the world. It is a huge park, with many different areas, trails, things to do. I spend 7 days and couldn’t do everything I wanted. Must sees: Santa Elena Canyon, Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive, Chisos Basin, Sunset in Sotol Vista Overlook, Lost Mine Trail, and much much more.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "It's amazing here. Simply. Amazing. Highly recommend a 4 wheel drive vehicle as there's shortcuts you can take and entire areas of the park you just can't get to if you are in a smaller car.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This is second to the Grand Canyon when it comes to views and hiking... The hardest hike I’ve tried was the Lost Mines Trail but everyone should try the Santa Elena Canyon trail and spend some time by the river... it’s so relaxing", rating: 5 },
    { body: "One of the most scenic places I've ever been, that includes Colorado, Utah, Alaska, etc. The views don't disappoint, and there are tons of great hiking options. The park is absolutely massive, so be prepared for a decent amount of driving within the park. Go check out the Chisos Basin and see the mountain views, and Santa Elena Canyon is incredible and not to be missed. Most people wouldn't believe they were in Texas. It's a long drive but well worth it!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Absolutely beautiful! We camped in the back of our AWD Escape and it made it down the primitive road to Gravel Pit. Horses and cows hang out at the end of that road form across the river. Truly a wonderful experience. Be careful with the food boxes they have though, wasps were living in the handle of the one at our site.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "We stayed 5 nights, 10/28 through 11/2/2020, the weather was great with cool mornings and nights and warm afternoons. The accommodation, shopping and eating experiences were noticeably different than previous years due to the coronavirus. The hiking, as usual, was the best. The virus had no impact on those experiences and masks were worn when social distancing was less than 6 feet. We also witnessed a black bear in a tree eating whatever it liked in it.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Very exciting park with a ton of stuff to see. Our favorite were: - Grapevine Hills - Emory Peak - Santa Elena Canyon - Lost Mine - South Rim I would advise you to book campground in advance because your options will be limited if you do it in person. We didn’t and were very satisfied with our campsite. Ranger are helpful except at the Chisos visitor center where I heard a ranger making fun of a guy saying he was afraid of the rain. The ranger answered “there is no rain in that season”. The evening of that answer it rained a lot. Maybe they need to learn how to read a forecast, especially when a visitor ask about it (pretty reckless if you ask me).", rating: 5 },
    { body: "It was free when I visited but so much was closed it was a little disappointing. Getting here isn't a small task and with the hot springs and Santa Elena Canyon Overlook and trail closed, plus all the visitor centers, you're kinda left on your own. I did see plenty of tarantulas on the road, and flowers in bloom but given the size of the park, plan to spend a day driving it. If everything was open, I'd probably give it 4 stars.", rating: 3 },
    { body: "What an incredible piece of Texas. The words and pictures do not do it justice. The national park folks are doing a great job in spite of all of the 2020 stuff.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Wished had more time to explore the park. If you only have one day, I highly recommend to do The Window Trail. I did this hike right before sunset.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Very quiet here. Beautiful place for a desert. The boarder crossing and hot spring were closed due the COVID.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "It’s vast. From fort Stockton to Santa elena canyon is nearly 6 hours round trip. But it’s very beautiful and you can’t do justice in one day. You need 3 or more days to explore the various trails and hikes.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Wow wow wow. Even with partial covid closures and in the dead heat of summer, we loved every mile of the drive and every step of trail. Rangers were excellent, and helped us maximize our time. We even got to see a family of bears walk through, and I felt much better with rangers at my back! Lost Mine trail was incredible - if it's hot, start early. Most of the trail will be in the shade until midday. Spectacular views. Also highly recommend Boquillas canyon trail to experience the Rio Grande River, and the Chihuahuan desert trail at Dugout wells is a perfect, short walk to round out your day. Definitely try to drive as much of the park as you can, and do one mountain, river and desert trail to get the full experience! The park is vast and every mile is different. The best NP of the three we saw on this trip", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Totally gorgeous sunrises and sunsets, and the night-time stars are absolutely stunning! Completely worth the trip!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Great place for a family getaway. Be ready for lots of hiking! Fill up at panther junction if you are going down to castolon!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Amazing National park, and well worth the 8 hour drive from Austin. The Mountains are magnificent and quite large. They are really nicely sized prominent mountains, lost Mine Trail was completely enveloped in fog though. I camped at the Chisos Basin Campground and I loved it (I got a surprise thunderstorm during the night which was a little scary but it was also fun!). It's very busy so make sure you reserve well in advance! Otherwise you'll have to fight for first come first serve campsites. Also if you take Old Maverick road from Santa Elena canyon North, just be aware the road is ROUGH!", rating: 5 }],

    { body: "Our experience was great. We went with Captain Tom, private charter and he made it not only educational but awesome! The islands were pretty! there was one key... Elliot’s Key I think that had garbage washed up in the ocean side.. which you would think the park rangers would maintain. We went snorkeling say a sing ray and other fish and just hung out all day in the ocean it was amazing.", rating: 5 },

    { body: "Fascinating place with so much to learn regarding the wonders of what makes Florida an amazing and unique place! All the staff, rangers and guides were exceptional and provided a wealth of information. Highly recommend a visit to Biscayne NP and take part in one of the activities that will get you in the water to fully experience what this area has to offer.", rating: 5 },

Tom went above and beyond to make our outing happen, was a wonderful host, taught us so much about about the National Park and even snorkeled with us to help us find some very cool sea-life!!! I highly recommend this outfit if you want to explore Biscayne NP!! Thank you Tom!!", rating: 5 },

    { body: "It is a quiet and charming place for people looking for peace and relaxation", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Went on a tour of the National park with Tom from Explore Miami Boat Rental. I couldn't recommend him more. Unfortunately we went out on a very windy day where seeing a lot of life in the water was not possible and we weren't able to go snorkeling. However, Tom was very knowledgeable about the park, the area, was a great person to spend the day with out on the boat. It felt a lot more like being out on the water with a good friend. And not to mention the very reasonable pricing Tom puts out. 100% would go back, and would recommend.", rating: 5 },

    'Black Canyon of the Gunnison': [{ body: "All I can say is wow! Truly the underdog of National Parks. The snow was firmly packed, so I didn't need snowshoes or skis, but I saw plenty of people having a great time doing just that! I went as far as Cedar Point, and it became clear to me that lighting / timing is everything to really make these canyons pop. Cameras don't do the depth and length of these canyons justice either. It's just a visit you have to make to truly visualize 2400 feet down. I highly recommend this place if the weather is favorable!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "In my opinion, this is one of the most underrated national parks. You won't find tons of people here, but you will find a stunning canyon. I've been to the Grand Canyon and I thought this was more impressive. Don't get me wrong, the Grand Canyon is amazing, but the sheer drop offs into this rocky canyon will take your breath away. Most people only go to the south rim. Don't make that mistake. You need to go to the north rim. My favorite view in the park was from Exclamation Point. It's a 3 mile round trip hike that's pretty flat. We also did the north rim drive and stopped at the handful of overlooks. It's about a hour and a half from the south rim, so you could squeeze them both in one day, but it's probably better to do it on a separate day. On the south rim we did the south rim drive and stopped at Pulpit Rock Overlook, Chasm View, Painted Wall View, Cedar Point, Sunset View, and Gunnison Point Overlook (all roadside overlooks). At the end of the drive, we also hiked the Warner Point Nature Trail which was about 1.5 miles and easy. There's not much hiking at this national park, it's more overlooks, but there are a handful of hikes you can do. If you're in Colorado or anywhere near it, this national park is for sure worth a stop.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This is one of the most remote and one of the hardest national parks to access, but it is well worth the drive.

    { body: "11/13/20 All in all a very pleasant stop in the National park. The views are so unusual that I had to remind myself on several occasions that this is real. This being winter season, the best auto road - the East Portal road - is closed, so I did the driving route near the south visitor's center and two short hikes on the designated hiking trails - Cedar Point and Warner Point. All of the overlook paths were well prepared, with steps and handrails in some places. There is not of change in elevation in the overlook paths or the two trails I walked, so it is not hard work. Some of the overlook paths DO come close to sheer drops, so don't bring your pets or leave frisky children unattended. Folks who don't like high places could get very uncomfortable around here. I spent about two hours in the Park, had fun the whole time, and left feeling I had seen enough for one day. Will come back in the summer and try the East Portal road and perhaps the ambitious 'scramble' down to the river. The hike is less than a mile, but includes 1800' change in elevation. I took a few photos, but they really don't do justice to the views here. The eye itself has trouble interpreting the view.", rating: 5 },

Did not see as much wild life as I did at Great Dunes Overlook hike, but since this park is free now there are a lot more people. I guess for free this is 5 stars. Just need to find some less traveled trails could make it better. Second day explored North Rim. Way less crowded and more in true natural setting. Even saw some fresh bear tracks and deer. A lot of dirt road travel. So don't wash your car before you go there. On South Rim Balanced Rock view was closed, but on North there was a trail that overlooked it so close you could almost touch it. Most of the morning I was on trails by myself, only later did encounter one other person. So way less crowded than South Rim. The North Rim excursion really made my trip perfect.

    'Bryce Canyon': [{ body: "Entry fee is $35 (I suggest you buy a $80 Annual national park fee). One of the best national parks in the world. It’s my most favorite national parks in US. We did a winter see around the park. Hiked in the sunset point with a 2 year old. Only the sunrise, sunset, Bryce view point and inspiration point are open. The canyon offers its best both in the summers and the winters. Winter covers the national park in complete fog and snow making it difficult for a good view. So check the snow fall readings before you plan a visit. It gets dark by 5 so you can manage 2 short hikes in a day. Go with complete snow gear to bare the cold and snow.", rating: 5 },

Prepare to spend all day here hiking the many different trails. To get the whole experience, hike counter clockwise by staring at Sunset point and taking the Navajo Loop Trail to the Queens Garden Trail. It's usually less packed then going clock wise. This is a fairly moderate hike. Take your time and enjoy it. Also drive up to Paria View and to Bryce point. There is a $35 per car fee to enter. Stop by the visitor center first to get all of the info you need for you hikes, etc...", rating: 5 },

A nice easy hike that passes through all the best POI the park has to offer. The views of the snow covering the red rock and hoodoos were unreal! After the hike, I took a ride to all the ascending points. Bryce and Rainbow are a must, the views are absolutely insane! TIP: Ice spikes are a must if going during the winter time.", rating: 5 },

If you walk down, it'll be about 30/45min to get to the main cavern with plenty of stalagmite views along the way. From the big caverns, you can decide to leave (elevators), use the restrooms, buy a snack, mail a letter (the novelty!) or continue a large loop around the big caverns, which will be another 1/1.5 hrs. It is cool. Probably not great for young kids. Very dark and dim, but there's enough ambient lighting that you should be fine. Make sure you bring a jacket, the temp is about 50 degrees. We came too late in the season to see the bats, but plan to go back during spring to see the bats leave the cave in the evening.", rating: 5 },

The caverns are extremely well maintained, with sufficient sign boards/informational boards posted at appropriate locations.

A special shout out to Margaret (on of the rangers) who dedicated a LOT of time to explain things to us. The caverns themselves were spectacular, and are worth spending at least half a day exploring. If you are in New Mexico, do not miss this National Park! Note: If you are interested in viewing the bat migrations, do visit prior to winter.", rating: 5 },

Each of the 5 islands has a unique character with varying degrees of infrastructure and people, so you can find which one you like the most over time. Everyone always talks about Joshua Tree, Yosemite, or heading to some beach if they want to get out of Los Angeles, but Channel Islands will be my new go-to from now on.

I enjoyed the 5 or so mile hike around the island where you can see beautiful ocean shores, amazing green rolling hills (felt like Ireland), and spectacular time lapse feel into a simpler time with little around to disturb the mind. There are remnants of old buildings there left for education and history. I guess the amazingly green grass and wild flowers were brought by colonists who herded sheep here. And it's now taken over the island. You take a boat ferry to the island where you have about 4 or 5 hours to enjoy. You should bring something to eat and 2 litres per person to drink. The ferry ride is nice and smooth and educational. Definitely bring you camera. Here are some pics I took.", rating: 5 },

Well developed trails and lots of opportunities for great views. The boat passage is teeming with dolphins and birds.", rating: 5 },

Awesome coastal view along the trail to cavern point and potato harbor from the piers. Visible island foxes within reach. Crystal clear water perfect for swimming and snorkeling. The best part was the adventurous kayaking tour in and out of the coastal caves. A very unique experience that allowed us to navigate through the chambers inside the caves and see colorful waters, fish, kelps, different kinds of birds, etc. Our guide even gave us fresh kelp to eat. Yum.", rating: 5 },

It was beautiful and relaxing and if you love an easy (and Ada friendly “hike”) you could easily plan a 5k stroll at this park simply by Parking in the back of the visitor center lot and taking the boardwalk.

The park has several trail options for explorers of all ages and skill range, including a paddling trail. There's campgrounds as well which appeared to be accessible just off the main road.

It’s really nice in the autumn with pleasant weather and changing leaves, and it’s outside the main busy travel season of summer, though any time of year is great. The river is really clear and chilly, so it’s good for fishing, wading (where it isn’t rapids), and kayaking. The Ohio and Erie Canal trail and path goes right through onto Cleveland, about a mile away from downtown. It’s very cyclist-friendly, but there were many people walking when I went on it as well. It’s partially paved, partially sand/gravel, but it’s firm, so even on road bike it’s not bad at all. There is no charge for entrance, so there really isn’t any reason not to stop in, and considering two interstates go right over it including the Ohio Turnpike.

Barbecue is available on campsite.. and I recommend furnace creek visitor center to buy fridge magnet..", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Another must if you’re in Vegas! It’s a little bit farther of a drive than Red Rock but we’ll worth it. There is so much to see so make sure you get off to an early start. Dante’s View is absolutely AMAZING as well as Zabriskie Point", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Visiting Death Valley was an enjoyable experience, but something I would recommend to be done just once. I spent about 4-5 hours visiting the sand dunes, zabrieski point, artist palette and bad water. After that, you're done and you go home! 4/5 ⭐", rating: 5 },

We visited a Sunday which was not appropriate since we've had a huge amount of people. We've been quite disappointed by the crowd and didn't visit all the spots we wanted. If I had to choose one area, I would say the artist's palette was the most interesting.", rating: 3 },
    { body: "Stunning vistas and colors for photography, and extremely dark at night for astrophotography. I prefer to go there in the winter months, but the trade-off is the popular spots can get fairly crowded. Photographers plan ahead to look for days with low wind speeds! The Artists Palette is a crazy one-way drive, and the actual Palette is not the first stop where the parking is - it's further down the road. People don't be ghetto - pay the $30 to get in!", rating: 5 },

    'Denali': [{ body: "Beautiful National Park in Alaska. We had our best time at this park. Bus trips provided by the NPS helped us a lot to see wilderness of this national park. We saw Grizzly Bears on that trip. We never forget watching Northern Lights from this park. Absolute stunning.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "The best outdoor experience ever in my life! I went Denali with other 2 female friends, we booked two nights camping ⛺️ in the wonder lake! I was terrified of encounter with Monsieur bears 🐻 when we went to hiking and camping in the night! But still, those are quite funny when we recalled those memories later! 🤣", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This place will leave you beyond words! We were a group of friends visiting and we first approached the staff who handed us the map consisting of trail pathways ranked by difficulty and elevation. We did the Healy Mountain Overlook trail and the view after you reach the top is soo gorgeous and worth the effort!! Just keep hydrating yourself along the way.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Denali National Park and Preserve has so much to offer. We camped at the Wonder Lake campground for two nights. The ride to/from the campground was so enjoyable, including dynamic, breath taking scenery and sightings of wild animals. During our ride, we saw a red fox, a brown bear, a herd of caribou, a golden eagle, and lots of rabbits and ground squirrels. Even though the bus ride is almost 5.5 hours, we never got bored. We were also lucky to see Mt. Denali while we were camping. Two storms pushed away the smoke, and we woke up to a view of the Alaska range, from east to west. There is only one established trail in the Wonder Lake area, McKinley bar trail. It is a relatively flat 4.8 mile round trip trail, and you will walk through the tundra to taiga and reaches the river. There are blue berries along the way, too. Even though we got rained on multiple times, we had a great time. I recommend staying at least 2 nights to explore different areas of the park. Our 3 nights stay was not enough, and we will come back again to explore some more.", rating: 5 },

    { body: "We flew to anchorage and rented a car. The next day we drove to Denali National park. The Denali National park is a massive Alaskan wilderness. Unfortunately the mountain was not visible. One of the highlights of our trip was the train ride from anchorage to Seward. We sat in the glass dome section of the train which had stunning views of the mountains, rivers, and waterfalls! We also enjoyed a four hours boat tour to see glaciers and sea lions", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This is the most beautiful National Park I have visited. What I like best is their approach to preservation: let nature take its course. The rangers teach you to respect the land in all its glory and wildness.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Best season is during the warmer summer months. There is not much wildlife in the winter due to hibernation. Denali also has a rich and amazing flora. Wildflowers begin to bloom in early June till late July. There is only one road in Denali. Private vehicles can drive a small part of it, but most of the road is open only to bus traffic. Bus trips are available only in summer (roughly mid-May through mid-September). All bus trips are operated by a private company with a contract to do so - not by the National Park Service. Denali is definately worth it. Spend some time and get off the bus and do some hiking in Denali. Also, if you can afford it - try to go on a Mt. McKinley flight tour with a company like Talkeetna Air Taxi, or someone else. Three days will get you deep into the heart of Denali National Park in a way that is much more enriching than a quick day visit. You'll have time—and space—to soak in the grandeur and the vastness of Alaska's most iconic national park. Three days in Denali is just good for the soul!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "I love this beautiful and wonderful place. You can travel about 20 miles to the park and park on the side of the road for a walk enjoying nature or even taking pictures. After that you have to take the bus paying the ticket, where they will take you inside the park. Denali has a lot to offer, Me, my wife and my children and your friends visit in winter and we spend the ski season and we also camped at Wonder Lake camp for two nights and the next day We had lunch at the Wilderness Lodge restaurant. The hiking trip to the camp was so pleasant it warmed in the cold, even at night you could see the northern lights in the sky, along with the bright stars, breathing natural air from the landscapes and watching the Arctic wildlife. During our tour we saw an orange fox, a brown bear, many caribou herds, a golden eagle, penguins, cows and squirrels. We also watched Mount Denali as we left the forest. There is a snowstorm that has cleared the fog and we can see people climbing the Alaska Range the highest point in North America. We were walking west, we had just found Wonder Lake. It was a journey of more than 4.9 miles, that you leave the Taiga Forest and will pass through the tundra and arrive at the river. Even though it snowed several times we had a great ride. I recommend to stay 2 days to explore all areas of the park. Our 7 days were very beautiful and pleasant moments.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "The view from the seaplane is simply breathtaking. You will definitely enjoy each and every part of it. The views are so good that you cannot forget them. If you are running out of time, then air tour is the best thing you can do and usally takes 2-3 hours for the entire round trip. Few air tours have a glacier landing which is worth taking them.", rating: 5 },

    { body: "This is a great National Park to see wildlife in their natural habitat, undisturbed by people. This National Park is very serious about keeping the 6 million acres of land in pristine condition. Lots of restrictions on what you can and can't do inside the park. The only way to see the entire 90 miles of road through Denali National Park is by purchasing a tour. Private vehicles are only allowed in for the first 10 miles or so. Lots of wildlife to see if you happen to come on a good day. If your lucky, you might even get to see Mount Denali. We arrived on a day when wildfires were happening in the area, so the smoke made it difficult to see anything. Also be prepared to ride school buses throughout the National Park if you purchase a tour. The road is not paved the whole way, so it's gets dusty and rough. Also bring extra water and snacks because nothing is sold once you entered the National Park. There are bathrooms available throughout the park.", rating: 4 },
    { body: "It was great! We saw Grizzlies, Caribou, Fox, Dahl Sheep, Moose, a piece of Mt. Denali and a lot of beautiful Views. The tour bus driver gave us Denali 101. If you could remember everything he said, you could be hired on with the park service. The buses now have small TV screens tied to the tour guides binoculars, so what he stops to see you can see it in the bus. It was awesome!!!. We went 62 miles into the park. It was worth every cent we paid. Making this a National Park is one thing the government did right. Bring Binoculars!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "A park that can only be truly appreciated over a multi day experience. I was there almost 5 days, experiencing rain and sunshine. One day of just me hiking and exploring. One day on the bus going the full length of the road. One day on a ranger led discovery hike. Bits of 2 other dates spent hiking and sitting in a cafe just outside of the park working. I saw all the animals except a wolf or a lynx. That was great and experiencing some of that with other people on the hike and bus was great (people get REALLY excited). I also beat the odds and saw Denali 3 days in a row. Each time I saw it I was struck by how enormous and majestic it is. Difficult to describe in words so I hope you see it, too! Be sure to go see the sled dogs and hear the informative ranger talk. The dogs were very friendly (you can pet them) and they seem to love their work.", rating: 5 }],
    'Dry Tortugas': [{ body: "If you are thinking about doing this trip, GO NOW. It is absolutely breathtaking on that island. There is plenty to do, such as walking the whole the fort yourself or with a tour guide, snorkeling around the moat, or just laying out by the beach. I would definitely go back to witness such a remarkable structure again.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "We camped here overnight. It was an awe inspiring experience! The beautiful water and plethora of fish made this snorkeling adventure outstanding! We wished we had stayed the two additional nights that were available but chose not to book. Once the boat left for the day, only about 16 people were left on the island. We felt like had the entire place to ourselves. The beach was empty other than our family of 4. That night, we were able to stargaze and see the Milky Way with our own eyes. Absolutely incredible. The fort was a lot bigger than we expected too. We will definitely come again and stay longer!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Simply Amazing. Beautiful beautiful beautiful. Well worth any amount of money spent to go. If I'm not mistaken it was around $200 per person for the boat ride which included breakfast and lunch, not a super fancy meal but something to get you through it. Word to the wise bring a cooler of drinks for yourselves, a good pair of sandals and maybe a hat but definitely sunscreen!! The boat ride there was 2 1/2 hours and same to come back and you get about 4-5 hours to spend there. It was plenty of time. It's not a big island not too much to really see so you can go see everything get all the pictures you want and still have hours to spend in the water or snorkeling. Snorkeling was amazing there are reefs right the edge of the island and plenty to see underwater. Gorgeous. Would definitely do it again. If you get any type of sea sick take all the medicine before going and again before leaving the island!! Our trip wasn't too rough on the water it's just a long trip.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Ferry on the way over is nauseating but once you get there it is magical. If you’re able to, please spend the night!! The views are incredibly of the sky. The fort is nice to walk around in but the sand and beach on the island is amazing. Walked into the ocean and immediately saw a stingray. So much wildlife among the coral reefs, it was a really cool experience.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "The best national park I’ve been to, so far. Even though it is pretty expensive to get there, this experience definitely worth it! We got there by ferry, and had time to explore the island from 10:25 till 2:45. Took guided tour through the castle, and after that we’ve done snorkeling and swimming in both beaches! Awesome experience!", rating: 5 },

    { body: "One of my favorite camping experiences. Although it's primitive camping - meaning you have to bring literally everything with you including food and water, it's really easy to pull off. They give you wheelbarrows, the ferry comes every day etc. It's absolutely amazing at night when all the tourists leave", rating: 5 },

    { body: "What a place! Perhaps one of the most unique NPs in existence: remote, small, raw and simple and absolutely beautiful. I camped 1 night and regret not staying at least one more. Camping is primitive only but the boat is there 10am-3pm every day and serves as restaurant, shower, bathroom, lounge, AC, etc. The fort is open sunrise to sundown and even that rule is flexible once the boat and day visitors leave, it is quite a place to see. The water is pristine and you will see plenty of purple coral, sharks, fish, wildlife, so snorkeling is a real treat. The night sky is unbelievable. Perhaps my favorite thing was seeing the F18s practicing dogfighting in the morning and evenings right in front of the park.", rating: 5 },

Great fishing and bird watching!", rating: 4 },

The museum part is engaging and informative, so don't worry if your ticket times are a little spaced apart because you'll have plenty to look at and read about between attractions. You should definitely get a combo ticket and do the documentary film before the tram in order to fully appreciate the structure once you travel to the top. The views are striking, yes, but what is truly breathtaking is the incredible engineering and artistic elegance that went into this modern monument.", rating: 5 },

The museum was open as was the gift shop and café. The ride to the top was closed, but they did have a web cam of what you'd see. There were some young men on skate boards making a movie by one of the legs. The park police was polite while clearly telling them what was allowable. Good positive communication that spanned generations. The concession outside the exhibit made great lemonade. Hot dogs were fair and pretzel sucked. Parking was convenient and fairly priced. Great way to spend an afternoon after going to the zoo earlier.", rating: 5 },

This would be a good day trip but I would not recommend traveling extensively to come see this attraction.", rating: 3 },

Seeing the mountain goats on the mountains, and the whales as you come in, the unique shade of teal of the water, and of course the incredible glaciers just profoundly shows the beauty of nature.

We saw mountain goats and marmots as well. We drove all the way to the top of going-to-the-sun-road... breathtaking scenery! We took the hike to Virginia Falls. The falls are huge and stunning. You can get absolutely soaked standing near them. The St. Mary’s falls are so pretty as well. The color of the water is Caribbean blue. Even though it is way up north the weather was wonderful! It is definitely a must-do vacation spot!", rating: 5 },

You can also take the train from Williams AZ, and even stay at historic lodges/hotels inside the park. - I highly recommend getting the National Parks Pass if you plan to visit more than one National Park in a year - Don’t go in the summer... late fall and early spring are perfect, but so is winter when the snow is on the caps - Get ice cream by the hotel - Take your time... and bring food with you cause you’re gonna get ripped off at Grand Canyon Village which is just before the entry to the park Enjoy!

Please carry water and energy drink for your trek. There are toilets on the way down however you'll need to trek a lot to reach these facilities. I only saw one drinking water facility however it said that water needs to be treated before drinking. This trek is not for everyone.

I went for a morning hike by Jenny Lake and was absolutely captivated by the reflection of Grand Teton over the water. It was quite possibly the most picture-perfect serene place I’ve ever been to.

At approximately 310,000 acres (480 sq mi), the park includes the major peaks of the 40-mile-long Teton Range as well as most of the northern sections of the valley known as Jackson Hole. Grand Teton National Park is only 10 miles south of Yellowstone National Park, to which it is connected by the National Park Service-managed John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Along with surrounding national forests, these three protected areas constitute the almost 18,000,000-acre Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, one of the world's largest intact mid-latitude temperate ecosystems. This is in my top 3 parks I have visited. It was clean, fresh and beautiful. I was amazed at its beauty. All the ranger I encounter was friendly and professional.

Mountain and lake landscapes are my favorite and that's what you'll find at this park. We didn't spend enough time here in my opinion. We had two days, but I would have loved to spend several more. Some of our views weren't clear because of the haze from the west coast wildfires. The two hikes we did while we were here were the Taggart Lake Trail and the hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. Both were beautiful, but Taggart Lake was my favorite. We also went to String Lake and walked around for a bit which was really pretty. Jenny Lake has good views right by the parking lot. We tried to go to Oxbow Bend, but it was too hazy to see the Tetons. Get to the parking areas early. We were there at the end of September and most filled up by 9am.

Both lakes are beautiful but I recommend the spring or summer, in the fall and winter they are dry and shallow and freeze solid. I have not yet climbed Wheeler Peak but I will when I return. It is an all day hike and it is well worth it for the views. The campgrounds are great and well maintained. I really like the Upper Lehman sites.

I have been waiting for a year to visit Great Basin and it lived up to the hype from the amazing stars you can see it at night!! The hikes are amazing especially the Bristlecone Pine Trail and the Glacier Trail! Although we did not do the Lehman Caves, I still strongly recommend this national park to visit with your friends and family. Keep in mind that when we visited here there were no camping sites even though it’s a first come first serve basis to reserve a camping spot. I wish all camping sites are done by reservations however Grey Cliffs Campground is a group reservation that you can book as a group. I totally enjoyed seeing the stars at night!! It’s super amazing and I am looking forward to coming back here to visit and hit Wheeler Peak and the Lehman Caves when they reopen to the public due to the current circumstances here in 2020.", rating: 5 },

Hosting the tallest sand dunes in North America, this vast area is sure to wow all who visit. Hiking to the top of the dunes is no easy feat, but well worth it for the unique view, its just like how you imagined the Sahara desert would be, but here in the foothills of the Sangres. Many people bring sleds and boards to ride down the dunes, or some just run, jump, or roll down them. In late Spring and early Summer, snowmelt from the Sangres feeds a creek that will run down through the base of the park, creating a seasonal flood plain that brings a bit of watery fun to the park. There is camping located in the park, or more secluded camping can be located within an hour outside of the park. Do yourself a favor and take the time to come spend a day out here, you won't be disappointed.", rating: 5 },

We did not take the time to hike the highest peaks of the dunes however I can only imagine the views are even better from up there. Do not expect to be alone in this park As there are many visitors daily. Very family friendly environment especially in the lower part of the sand dunes where the sand surfing primarily takes place. From the parking lot it is about a 1520 minute walk just to the beginning of the dunes. At that point you Choose how far you want to go in to the dunes as there are endless choices and opportunities for different vantage points and hiking level abilities. You may want to consider a soft type of shoe as you were literally hiking in ankle deep sand and rocks the entire time.", rating: 5 },

We arrived around 10am, it was $25 to get through the gate. Not too many cars when we got there. There’s a gas station and shop a little before the actual parking lot to get into the sand dunes. I’m guessing this is where you can rent the cool boards to slide down the dunes in. Our 5 year old was in awe and loved playing in the sand. She was such a trooper! I wish we had more time to explore the area, but we will definitely be back. Everyone should experience this place once in their lives! I still have sand in my sneakers a week after our visit. Wear some good sandals if you remember!", rating: 5 },

The dunes are so vast that even with a decent crowd you can easily be half a mile from the next visitor. I also enjoy that there were outdoor shower facilities and water for washing the sand off. Sandboarding seems to be popular but those sand boards seem a lot heavier than snowboards and it’s warm out on those dunes so carrying them around in the heat didn’t seem fun. Also good cell coverage with Verizon.", rating: 5 },

If you want to see more stars thsn you ever have, take a walk to the dunes after dark. Truly amazing. The park is open 24 hours a day. Hiking the dunes is s great time and those of all ages enjoy sledding of boarding down the sand. You can rent a board or sled at the Oasis campground right at the entrance to the park. There is other hiking within the park that is beautiful as well.", rating: 5 },

Also the gift shop is extremely small and entirely lacking, especially compared to Carlsbad. Also no gas stations for a 100 mile stretch of highway so HEADS UP! Come with a full tank of gas!!

The Kilauea access is closed off with signs saying there is danger of a possible eruption, but making your way to the steam vents is still pretty fun. We had a good time seeing how long we could stand in the steam vent. It's a short walk from the parking lot to the viewpoint. We all did it in flip flops, as we made this a morning stop en route to our snorkeling spot.", rating: 5 },

It was great to explore that park and see evidence of its enormous natural volcanic activities. The best place to start is at the Visitor Center, so you can get your bearings and find out about the original history of the National Park and about the recent activity of the volcano. Then you can stop at various points around the huge caldera to get to see the special geological effects created by the volcanic activity over the years.", rating: 5 },

The hot springs run under the town and you’ll see multiple fountains and places where the water is steaming even in cold weather. There are water filing stations too. The town offers nice food places, bathhouse experience and a laid back weekend if you want to do that or you can do long trails. A very nice and peaceful town. Will definitely visit again.", rating: 5 },

Comfortable clothes and shoes and leave it better than you found it because it's a treasure. To add there are picnic tables up the road on the hill so grab a bite in town and drive or hike for a great meal in great environment. There is a lookout point near the observation tower as well.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "If you are planning to visit Arkansas the you must keep Hot springs National park in your trip plan. It’s an amazing place. You will see a real Natural Geyser there. The park is huge. If you like hiking small hills then you will like exploring the park. Down the hill there is pool where from you can enjoy awesome Natural Geyser flowing down the hill. The water is hot but not enough to burn your hands instantly, just be careful not to be exposed to the water for long time. You will see thrown coins in the pool. Spring water getting in contact with the hot rocks deep inside the earth is the reason for the flowing of hot water. It’s the Geo thermal source helps running the hot water springs. Another amazing thing should never miss is the Bath house. While exploring the city you will see many old bath houses where people use to take bath with the natural hot water from the spring. The Bath houses are no longer functional but became one of the main tourist attentions in the city. If you are planning to visit in Summer jut be extra cautious to hydrate yourself frequently as you might loose lot of water from your body while climbing the hills. Have a nice trip!", rating: 5 },

That was so wonderful too!!", rating: 5 },

Bring your own jug or bottle and there is a fountain with spigots to take some home! For the kids and kids at heart there's a great magic show Maxwell Blade as good as any in Vegas. There's also magic springs theme park with a water park as well as thrill rides. Take a duck boat tour of the lake or a haunted walking tour of downtown. Don't forget mid America museum for the little ones. You won't be disappointed!", rating: 5 },

There is only one you can actually take a mineral bath in and I believe that's concession-run and costs $. It's FREE to enter the park and park your vehicle. Fill up your water jugs downtown with hot mineral water at the public fountain. The hot water comes straight from the springs!

West Mountain also an additional opportunity to view the city from another site. City residents are very welcoming and enjoys giving recommendations of where to find the Hot Springs water spouts where you can fill your jugs of the famous water for free! Topping off historic sites there is also Oaklawn Casino and Racetrack. Two great food places include The Purple Cow (cute burger place) and Rocky's Corner Pizza! Totally a treasure to vacation to and has become one of my favorite spots.", rating: 5 },

    'Indiana Dunes': [{ body: "I wasn't really expecting much prior to coming here and was mostly going to do the 3 Dune Challenge, but was pleasantly surprised how nice this park was. There were a few different hiking trails to do, with a combination of climbing sand dunes to traditional nature walks through the woods. You can even access the beach at the lake. Both the visitor center and learning center were open when I was there this past summer. This was definitely a cool place to visit and a good workout.", rating: 5 },

No sweeping views from mountain tops (or mountains themselves) or big ancient trees or interesting rock formations. The dunes themselves are pretty impressive as well as the historical buildings. There are some nice costal areas with distant skyline views of Chicago. Also if you walk along the coastline far enough you can find some nice private places to take a dip into Lake Michigan. If you do find yourself here, make sure you don’t miss the sunset.", rating: 5 },

Just 15 miles long with the tallest dune being 127 feet, we were underwhelmed after visiting Great Sand Dunes in Colorado just a few weeks before. If you’re camping, you can get the off grid, in-the-woods experience like we did, or you can drive two miles down the road and get a much better Indiana Dunes State Park experience, which is at the beach and has 134 electric sites. Overall, it’s like going to the Outer Banks or any other beach town that has marsh and dunes. Not of National Park stature in our humble opinion.", rating: 5 },

There are multiple trails with interesting scenery and delightful beaches with plenty of room to enjoy the sun, lake, and dunes while staying distant from other groups. The water was beautiful and we had a lovely time hiking on the beach and checking out cool rocks. All the other people were respectful of social distancing and it was over all a pleasant experience. Don’t forget to stop at the visitors center to get you stamp but bring a mask as they are required to go inside (you don’t have to go inside to get your stamp).", rating: 5 },

They were super helpful inside and recommended we do the Dune Succession trail based off of what we were looking for (great views, beach access). I highly recommend this trail! It’s almost entirely on a boardwalk (which means less walking in sand) but there are a lot of stairs. From the parking lot there is a much shorter trail that brings you straight to the beach, but in my opinion you’re missing out on the good views by taking that route. On a clear day you can see the Chicago skyline from across the lake. Absolutely a must visit.", rating: 5 },

By the time you dock, go through orientation, and get back early to board, it's more like 3-3.5 hours. The island is nice. Unfortunately, when we were there it was really foggy and then rainy at the end. We hiked to the Grace Creek Overlook which was about 3.5 miles round-trip. It was pretty easy. The views were ok, but nothing spectacular. We also went over to the campground to do some moose watching and we did see one. This was the best part in my opinion. This national park is very remote.

The only way to get there is by boat or small plane. You can bring kayak’s or canoes and explore or you can hike and explore. It is possible to do just a day trip but we suggest doing a several night trip. There are many moose on the island, so you may have a chance to see one, or maybe you could catch sight of beaver or fox. We were dropped off at Windigo and picked up on the other side of the island. It was about a four-five day hike, but we put in 12-15 miles a day. Be prepared for portions of the trails to be somewhat overgrown. Some campsites have shelters that you can get on a first come first serve basis but many sights are just for tent camping. The shelters are simple but a great break from having to set up and sleep in a tent. There is very little plumbing on the island, so be prepared for a lot of ports potty sitting.

It is a beautiful secluded place where you can relax and take a breather. Get ready for the hikes too! They can vary a lot, going from steady to suddenly steep, and those moments can be exciting.

    { body: "I loved our national parks and Katmai really stands out. To visit we took a seaplane from Anchorage as there are no roads to Katmai. This makes it one of the wildest national park in our system, but makes the view of seeing the bears catch fish all more impactful.", rating: 5 },

    { body: "This place is amazing. Bears, bears, everywhere! The Park Rangers do an incredible job educating everyone that passes through on safety and keeping a very close watch to ensure all the rules are followed. They're always happy to answer questions about the bears, from educating about the species & how they live to identifying the bears that are around. There is also plenty of other wildlife to enjoy, especially birds. If possible, I would suggest camping instead of going on a daytrip. The platforms feel like a ghost time during the mornings and evenings, and there were multiple points where I was able to sit down, stretch my legs out, and just enjoy a little quiet time with the bears. No place on Katmai is safe, but the campground is comfortable and the electric wire fence that encourages the bears to keep out is well constructed. With all this said, please do not go here if you are not prepared to respect the rules. This is not a zoo and while these bears are habituated to humans, they are wild. At times it was discouraging to see Rangers having to shout at guests who seemed to be intentionally ignoring their instructions. This is one of the most magical places on the planet that anyone could ever hope to visit and hopefully we can keep it that way & not mess it up for the next generation.", rating: 5 },

No wait for the falls platform during those times. Lake/bridge platform was just as awesome as the falls platform, since babies hang out there with moms. Tent campground was wonderful and affordable (book permits well in advance - the day they go on sale). Water is potable, but I wish I had brought my water filter as it did not taste the best. Rangers are wonderful to talk to - they really know the bears. Food at the lodge was pricey but good, and a nice break from eating freeze dried camp food. Coffee quality varied, but I can't complain cause bears! This park was the highlight of our 2 week vacation. Highly recommend staying a few days rather than a day trip.", rating: 5 },

We saw a mama bear with 3 cubs before we even left the building that you watch the educational video and get some training from rangers. Once we got to the viewing platforms, it was amazing and an unforgettable experience. It’s not cheap to get there, but this is you stereotypical Alaskan “bears catching salmon” scene that’s everyone sees. We were lucky to go at the right time since the bears aren’t always as plentiful, but what a neat experience getting to get that close to these majestic creatures and not fearing for your life. These bears are used to humans and focused on fish, but the rangers do an excellent job ensuring everyone’s safety. Highly recommended!", rating: 5 },

You can get super close to bears and they don't mind people- they are there for the fish. I would recommend this place to almost anyone. There is a 1 mile hike in and you should be in walking health. Staff are very friendly and helpful. If you want to know if it is worth it look at the bear cam on their website during the salmon run", rating: 5 },

It is very remote and difficult to get to, very expensive as well given the access issues but the view of the salmons swimming upstream on Brooke's Falls and the bears trying to eat them is a treat for the eyes. We saw about 15 bears in that half day visit of which 11 we saw safely while watching from the platform built for visitors on the falls while the other 5 (a mother with 3 Cubs and then a lone bear) we ran into in the wild on our way through the jungle on the trail from the visitor center to the falls.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, only the Extended Historic self-guided tour is available in order to enter the cave, which is $18 per person for adults. It’s 2 miles long, takes about 2 hours, and only covers a small section of the cave, but it’ll still fascinate you. Carved by a river, there is very little lighting inside and is very dark, but just bright enough to see where you’re going (likely too dark for your camera to see anything). Highly recommended!", rating: 5 }],

Our site was awesome. After a couple days we ended up with neighbors who were local and just wanted to get drunk and puke in the bathroom on the floor. The bathrooms were always filthy and sometimes didn't have paper towels. We noticed that people really don't follow park rules and do what they want. We did enjoy all our hikes on the trails and met some really nice people. We felt bad for the park staff who were constantly having to do trash pickup on the trails but they were so awesome.

All in all, it was a fairly strenuous hike, and my legs were jelly by the end. You are supposed to stay within the rock walled path in order to avoid damaging the surrounding vegetation. However, lots of people decided to ignore this and wandered outside the clearly marked boundaries, which was pretty disappointing. Despite all of the people, there was relatively little trash, which was refreshing. We went during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most people were wearing masks (including us). Definitely bring a camera, lots of water, and some food! It is also a good idea to arrive EARLY. We got to the park at around 9am on Labor Day weekend and only had to wait for two cars.

    { body: "Great park that can be seen mostly from a car if you are time crunched or have mobility issues. Not just trees, lots of interesting landscape to take in. Trees don't disappoint though. They are bigger and more wonderful up close when you can touch them. From 100 feet away some look like they fell down a few years ago and it's shocking to see the detail preserved in quartz.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Words can't quite express the sense of awe one experiences when looking at the fossilized trees here! Every attraction at this National Park - right from the Blue Mesa trail, to the crystal forest, has something unique to offer. The best part about this National Park is that none of the attractions require a lot of hiking/walking; thus making it ideal for people who are short on time. If you are anywhere in the vicinity of this place, do carve out some time to visit it; it is totally worth the time!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "The Petrified Nation Forest was a truly wonderful experience. The National parks are always a great way to make a destination or a stop on a long drive. This will not disappoint. The view and colors are amazing, the history is fascinating. See petroglyphs, Native American Pueblo's, and if course The Ancient Petrified Forest! The gift shop and museums are great as well. Place for picnics and the staff and rangers are nice. Bring you own food for the day. You won't regret this experience in my opinion.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Wow! Petrified wood is mind blowing. Great park, well worth your time! Don't hesitate to go off the beaten path: trails are not developed in the park, but there's a lot to see. Ask rangers, they give print-out directions! We did Blue Mesa, it was a great hike", rating: 5 },

Side note.. when driving to the Park from the West, don't exit at the first sign you see for the forest, wait until you see the brown National Park signs to exit, trust me. There were no indoor restrooms at the entrance, there were port a potties 😫, Indoor restrooms were about 14 miles from that point. Through out the 28 mile Park, you will pull over and walk to explore the sights, plan for at least 2-3 hours.", rating: 4 },

Also, the painted desert is a site to behold. If you're headed towards the Grand Canyon from the east on I-40, definitely stop here on your way.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "This is a pretty remarkable experience. The park is very accessible, and can be enjoyed almost entirely from a car and veery short walks. It would be nicer if there were more hiking options and off the beaten trail sightseeing options. The landscape is remarkable, but if you've been to the Badlands before, this is a very unnoteworthy setting (except for the plethora of petrified wood). During our trip, we found multiple tourists who were raiding artifacts.", rating: 4 },
    { body: "I only went to visitors center. No shade from what I saw. But the place is gorgeous, unique and has amazing souvenirs. Also a derp history and helpful staff. I always want to stop but cant, even if you just go to visitor center (which is free) it is worth it.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "I visited the monument. Firstly, let me say, this monument is no Grand Canyon. The geological feature aren't going to jump and leave you in awe. It's still very pretty and worth the visit. The petrified forest sits on the Colorado Plateau. It's very flat. Most of the sites are just that, flat with petrified wood scattered around. Still, like I said, it's nice. Plus there are paths to walk and meander. There are a few areas that sit on higher ground and overlook beautiful vistas. There are two visitors, one at each entrance. If you need to ask questions, that's the place to do it.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Really cool small national park. The painted desert part was my favorite, but the petrified wood was awesome as well, along with the many petroglyphs and dinosaur exhibits. Nice gift shop and great rangers to point you in the right direction. This park only has a few short trails to ‘hike’, but dogs are allowed as long as they remain on a leash. Water was available at the visitors station. I did not see any places to purchase food, other than a few gas stations quite some distance away, so bring any snacks you would want with you. This was a cool day trip and would be perfect for visiting the meteorite crater in Winslow Arizona nearby.", rating: 5 },

Trails are well marked, functioning water/bathroom stations and a variation between flat and elevation, something for all types of hikers and runners (when it's not 100 degrees). Some hikes have plenty of shaded areas for hot days. Campground facilities are well cleaned but with limited showers, so plan your clean up time well.", rating: 5 },

West is better if you prefer more large cacti up close to the trail and East is better if you prefer mountain views in the background.", rating: 5 },

We knew in advance not to expect much in the way of services and visitors centers being open, etc. due to COVID-19, but more was available than we expected and to our surprise the part was empty. Yes, there were people, but like a tiny fraction of the usual throngs of people that are usually here. It ended up making our visit one of the best ever. The morning we did the trails around the General Sherman tree was particularly amazing. We were there around 8 AM and there were just a handful of people in the whole area.

Plus, the scenic views that are on the opposite side of the road can be tricky to drive into. There are so many trails to do! We've done Matthew's Arm and that one is extremely difficult. It's about 10 miles round trip, from the parking lot to the waterfall. It's worth the trip. Just be sure to be prepared with water, snacks and good company.

One of the most remote National parks, I'd say :)", rating: 5 },

This park definitely left a memorable impression, not quite the same as the above two parks, but great in its own way - astonishing views at dusk and quite a few animals roaming around (not counting endless prairie dogs). The park has a loop road with a few stops to enjoy scenery. My personal favorite was the Little Missouri River overlook with its canyon. Can’t beat the views when the sun goes down. In addition, you can check out Maltese Cross cabin in the park where Theodore Roosevelt spent some time.", rating: 5 },

We drove to the beach of Maho Bay, famous for sea turtles, and folks did a bit of wading until a rain shower hit. This brings up a point: bring a poncho in case of rain. A lot of the tour vehicles are open air. These bays are all on the Caribbean Sea side of the Island. The Atlantic side has rougher pebbled beaches. Along the road in this area was a huge Mangrove forest in the salt marshes. However, the hurricanes leveled the Mangrove trees and they have not been able to recover. It is a driftwood wasteland. On our return trip to Cruz Bay and the ferry, we encountered some local donkeys. These are docile but wild. Their ancestors hauled the sugar cane to the mills.

The flies were really bad. Even with big spray we still got bit a lot. We saw quite a few bald eagles on Lake Kabetogama and one beavers dam. The rock garden was interesting to check out.

The Lake Kabetogama visitor center was smaller but also very nice. From here we took the boat tour to Kettle Falls Historic District. About a 5 hour round trip journey. We enjoyed hearing about the history of the Kettle Falls and the Kettle Falls Hotel. We saw many eagles, deer, ducks, and wilderness along the way. Short walks in the kettle falls area were easy and fun. The 3rd Center we visited was the Ash River visitor center and part of an historic setting and former lodge.

The visitor center has sleds that you can rent. I would recommend purchasing some wax for the bottom of your sled to give it a much more competitive edge as you are flying down the dunes!

About 5 to 7 min drive inside the park past the pay booth there is a boardwalk on the right which is nice to walk on with educational signs. The dunes are smaller and have more plants on them here than back deeper into the park. If you can get there a couple hours or more before sunset, You'll likely have spectacular sunset views after you've enjoyed the dunes. Take a saucer sled. Some of the hotels in Las Cruces loan the sleds out. Just ask.", rating: 5 },

If you want to do backpacking, much more planning is needed compared to Denali because of lack of facilities and easily available information regarding the park.

The place is like going to a different planet. We got lucky and got to see Elk, bears, wolves and many other wildlife species. (most without getting out of the truck) Definitely a bucket list check-off for us. My recommendation is if there is a road, even if it's not marked, go down it. Some of the best sights were down some of these hidden roads and it will get you away from some of the more active spots. Thanks to everyone for the hospitality.", rating: 5 },

With COVID-19 the park is closing at 5pm but that did not stop us from enjoying the landscape and having a good time. I left from San Francisco on a Saturday at 5:30 am and it was basically a 3hour drive to the main entrance of the park. We had plenty of time to enjoy most of the view spots along the main road and even play with some remaining snow in the woods. The downside was the Mirror Lake was completely dried due to no rain for the past year, to the point you could simply walk where the lake was supposed to be. As well the glacier point is closed during winter. Parking also can be limited at some specific locations in the park.

After an extra hour of driving we found a campgrounds. It had many empty spots and staff had us pack up and suggested two different spots off the highway. Fine. But, I made it clear it was my first experience in a national park, driving across canada, and with my two kids and partner. I figured the staff might try to be more accommodating. Nope. Beautiful place, just make sure you call and get their staff to set you up, website is confusing and switches between their local park and the Parks Canada website.

If you’re planning a trip, go to the Visiting Centre first. There you’ll be able to hike (or bike) on the Bruce Trail (you don’t have to do the entire trail, it’s pretty long) which will lead you to a beautiful place called Dunks Bay Lookout. After that, make your way back to the visiting centre and head to the Singing Sands BEACH. It is just a simple beach but there is a small trail you can walk through, beside the beach. After that, make sure to hit Cyprus Lake, where again there’s the continuation of the Bruce Trail [this part of the Park was inaccessible due to COVID restrictions, so please check the website and plan ahead]. The last place we hit was the Halfway Log Dump. [The road to his place is very bumpy and not properly maintained so please be prepared.] This place has a trail has well, which leads to this amazing clear water shoreline. The only bad experience we had at this location was black flies (they bite, a lot) please be prepared for this because it really hurts. We didn’t really go the last place Crane Lake and River because it was getting a little late and the weather was turning against us, so we had to head home. The park has a parking fee about $12 and if you go the visiting centre, there is a combo package. Which comes to around $48 which should cover all the parking locations. Please ensure you’ve extra set of clothes, swim gear, shoes, etc. It comes in real handy. Also ensure you’ve bug repellent at all times.

If you have pets, bring them here as they will also enjoy. There are plenty of washrooms in this area. It's an ideal place for camping. I would definitely recommend this place.", rating: 5 },

The hike to the grotto was a long walk and we took the Georgian Bay Trail which was the easier trail it was doable with our 3 children, ages 12, 7, and 1... and we carried the 1 year old most of the way! Down by the Grotto was a bit crowded even though we had reserved parking, we thought there wouldn’t be a lot of people. But other than that, nice trail! And beautiful waters. My older kids and I wanted to experience the grotto so we climbed down the rocks to get down, my 7 year old son really enjoyed climbing down the rocks! We had to do a bit of a mission impossible crawl to get down but it was really worth it!! I think the best way to get to grotto is to swim around but we can’t swim so we did the crawl. I saw reviews of the water being cold, but I didn’t find it cold, maybe because I was all worked up from The hike to the grotto or the crawl along the rocks but the water was really nice.

There are quite a few camping sites for tents and a few for RV. Be aware though, Buffalo can wander throughout the campground and we were woken up to one about 10 feet from our vehicle.

    { body: "Absolutely beautiful. My partner and I hiked out on the 70 Mile Butte Trail beginning at 7pm so it wasn’t too hot. We got a backcountry permit, which means that you can pitch a tent anywhere in the park as long as it’s 1km from the road. We camped out at the highest point of the trail (halfway in- took less an 1hr to get there) and set up camp. Trail was well travelled- you shouldn’t have any problem getting there once you have a brief glance at a map at the entrance of the trail. Once it got dark, we had a truly, truly incredible view of the night sky. This is a must go place for anyone wishing to try out astrophotography. Some tips if you choose to: bring a tripod (you really don’t have anything to prop a camera up otherwise, there’s no trees or anything), extra batteries, a headlamp, a sweater (gets a bit chilly at night); eat beforehand because of the fire ban, meaning you can’t set up your stove; and google Dark Sky conditions for the park to know what time is the best.

    { body: "One of the most beautiful places in the world. As an American who traveled to several of our nation's most popular national parks when a child in the 1970s and now laments how crowded and over-used and stressed many are it was simply astounding to spend a week at Gros Morne in 2012. Even at the height of Canadian tourist season it was empty when compared to any of the most popular US national parks. And the landscape is spectacular. From the Tablelands to Western Brook Pond the landscape can seem otherworldly---literally---the Tablelands are a World Heritage site and one of the few places on Earth that the mantle rises to the planet's surface. The Tablelands more resemble Mars, with its reddish tinted rocks and soil than what you would expect of a lush green North Atlantic province (and a drive down the main highway distinctly shows the contrast, green on one side as far as the eye can see and red on the other). Western Brook Pond is simply otherworldly as well. A beautiful wooded, then boggy set of landscapes unfold before you during the multi-kilometer hike to the pond's shore, where tour boats take you into this very remote fjord now closed to the sea. Towering cliffs surround you with abundant waterfalls descending every few hundred meters, with thick forest covering any land not too steep for them. At the eastern end a floating dock beckons the backpacker who has pre-registered to hike out the 38 miles through a seemingly impossible gorge trail. These are a mere few highlights. The people of Western Newfoundland are warm and welcoming and there is good lodging to be had as well as plenty of hiking, camping, and wilderness backpacking opportunities.

The lakes have a special emerald color, which works very well in photos. Visiting the glacier that forms the Athabasca River you realize what global warming and pollution do. The glacier has halved in size and I don't know if it will exist for more than 50 years. Or 20? There are indicators that show you where the glacier was 100 years ago, in 1982, etc. Another thing that, perhaps not surprisingly, made me think. On the river there are no fish except from a certain point downstream. Quite unusual for me. The canyons visited and the waterfalls are extraordinary, you have a lot of panoramas. Unfortunately, the camera cannot present the abyss or the depth of these places. The only solution is to visit the park.", rating: 5 },

I did the hemlocks and hardwood trail and checked out mill falls. I didn’t hike mill falls but I stopped at the spot where you can access it directly. The other hike took me 1.5 hours because I was so excited about the scenery I kept doubling back and forth on the boardwalk trail. Very gorgeous and worth it.

Wonderful for hiking, whether for a few hours or a few weeks in the back country... and it has DELIGHTFUL canoe/kayak routes such as the Frozen Ocean loop, which has conveniently situated huts to shelter in, and well maintained portages. WARNING: do NOT venture out too far into the biggest lake there, in little boats: just like on all large lakes, the weather can change in an instant and you could be capsized by the surprisingly large waves which can develop!! This is NOT a lake for newbies: if you want to go very far from shore, make sure you have survival equipment, wear your lifejacket even if you are a strong swimmer, and watch the weather like a hawk.", rating: 5 },

So we backpacked into the Auriols closer to Haines Junction, set base camp on the grassy moraine, and made excursions into the range from there. The park is well organized, the visitor centre is impressive and educational, and the park staff are incredibly knowledgeable.

Then, canoe for about 5kms, which includes a narrow stream where the depth of water is up till knee and we have to drag our canoe and that place is really narrow. Then, a small hike of 3-4 kms to reach the falls. The waterfall is tall and it could be a fun experience to climb on those rocks. It is also nice to simply relax under the sun. It is advisable to carry bug spray due to lots of mosquitoes in the forest. After all this effort the fall feels like a treasure.", rating: 5 },

Cameron waterfalls is so close and walking distance from nearby shops. Its usually windy at the lake but otherwise great place to have a picnic when the sun is out.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "As it was our first time there, we really enjoyed beauty's nature. The mountains were so close compared to Jasper and Banff. Hiking trails were close. As we went with toddlers, there is a lot to do for a couple of days with them. You could rent bikes from Pats bike rental (in town) we rented the Surrey as we had toddlers and we could all ride together. I highly recommend getting the hour not half hour as time passes so quickly from the enjoyment of riding through the town(good leg workout, 😆). We went on a hike with the toddlers at Blakiston Falls. The hotel we stayed at wasnt the best and I will write a review. The boat ride was great with a lots of history information. I personally found it a little pricey as we did not stop across the border as they mentioned prior to the panadamic. Staff were very laid back on the cruise. We sat on the lower level due to time of year weather, but were able to walk to the back of cruise and take pictures. Did not make it to Prince of Wales tea time but the view from there is amazing. Highly recommend going with family/friends to Waterton, Alberta. Dont forget the U.S. border is near by if you want to cross but dont forget your passports! Take Care and enjoy!", rating: 5 },

    { body: "Very beautiful town nestled in between mountains with a large lake. Town is small with a few food places but not much. If you're planning a 3+ hour drive down here, make sure you do a long hike or some water activities to make your trip worthwhile. Other than chilling by the lake and doing some water activities, there's not much else to do.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Great place for hiking, trekking or just to relax by the river. Several activities available including boating, ferry, bicycles. Many great food places. Love the fact that it's a little remote area so the feeling of being away from city life is refreshing. There is a nice play area for kids. No mosquitoes! Beautiful, clean and well managed park.", rating: 5 },

    { body: "Waterton Lakes NP is our favourite NP in Alberta. It’s small and quiet with just enough things to do. The lake is so nice on the hot days. Even after the 2017 fire it’s still very worth while. The views all around town are picture frame quality. It’s not overrun like Banff and Jasper it is just right. Make sure that you take in the bears hump and Bertha lake hikes as they are close to town and great for families. The Prince of wales hotel is iconic and the ice cream shop downtown is the best!! Surrounded by peaks during the day and stars overhead at night. Great dark skies photography. Always have a great time here!!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Best national park in Alberta! We had an amazing time here. Plenty of hiking, boating and breathtaking views! There are hikes for people of every level. Our favorite was the hike upto Bertha lake which features a waterfall a third of the way up. There was a lot of snow on the last third of the ascent so that did make it a little more difficult but doable especially if you have the right shoes! We also took the ferry ride which is a must do when visiting. It is first come first served when boarding, so get there early to sit on the top deck!", rating: 5 },

I’ve seen a couple of wildlife sightings and beautiful areas that is perfect for photoshoots. The water is just so clear and clean, the wind however will blow you away! You can make use of the wind by using Paddle Boat Sails/Wind Surfing or any other means of enjoyment to make use of the strong wind.", rating: 5 },

Its range is between the Rocky Mountains and prairies. This park contains 505 km2 (195 sq mi) of rugged mountains and wilderness.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Beautiful park at the edge of the country. The views here are unlike anywhere in Alberta with rolling hills, meadows and some gorgeous views. If anything I would recommend the Bear Hump Trail. It's strenuous for the newcomers but not hard as its paved and stared. Do carry a good jacket and head cover as its super windy. The town was beautiful too but we lived outside 30 mins away as it was cheaper.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Place has beautiful atmosphere. Little town and the people are friendly! Lots of activities to do and beat if you stay there for a night. Love the cruise at Shoreline, tour guide is so hilarious that you will never get bored! Dowtown resto is quite expensive! But yeah if you want to taste something new go for their local ice cream!", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Nice little spot but nowhere near as epic as the Banff/Jasper area. Food we had for lunch at a nice looking place was pure grease. We did make sure to buy souvenirs from 3 or 4 stores to support local business people. What made it a 4 instead of a 3 for me was the bicycle rental spot. We were able to bike, myself and my husband with our 6 month old pup between us and our two little kids in the basket style thing in front. There were some major issues with our seat but it was a great fun time overall. The main highlight would be the view from in front of the hotel.", rating: 4 },

    { body: "Beautiful out here. Gorgeous scenery. The downside is the wind. I have never been to any spot as windy as Waterton in my life. It is sometimes scary. You struggle with the wind to take pictures sometime. But then, the trip is worth it. Just love watching the beaches at Waterton and listening to nature.", rating: 5 },

Don't drive at night, because these large animals like to sleep on the road and they are dark and virtually invisible! This park has the largest night sky preserve in the world, so it's a fantastic place to see the Northern lights! Some of the trails were closed for maintenance while we were there, but we're managed to explore anyway :)", rating: 4 },

    'Yoho': [{ body: "Love the sights of Yoho, particularly Takakkaw and Wapta Falls. Takakkaw is a bit of a drive in but only about 5 - 10 min walk to the falls down a simple path. Wapta, while the parking lot is closer to the highway, is a bit more of a hike to get to but definitely worth it. Emerald Lake and the natural bridge are cool as well and there's a resort out there to stay at. Be careful when going back onto the highway, it can take some time to find space, some acceleration lanes would be nice, hopefully in the near future.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "Yoho National Park was one of the first national parks we passed through in our bus tour of the Canadian Rockies. The region is incredibly beautiful with some lakes, forest trails, camping sites, waterfalls and mountain peaks to be seen. There are some Alpine lodges where you can have a fine vacation and enjoy the scenery. We visited the Emerald Lake though we did not stop the night. It is off the Trans Canada Highway near the Kicking Horse Pass.", rating: 5 },
    { body: "What a scenic beauty. It's a pretty long walk to the falls. So, those who've health issues should better mind it. Not ideal to visit in the evening, especially in fall and winter. Please don't wear sneakers. Hiking shoes would be better.", rating: 5 },

Kayaking costs $60/hr but can fit 3 people easily, split it 3 ways then suddenly $10 goes a long way. It's a must see! The water is so calm and relaxing, the gorgeous, epic mountains surround you as you paddle in awe of the beautiful water. Would go back in a heartbeat. Just make sure you have an anti-mosquito spray as they can get pretty determined to eat you alive during your adventures. Other than that, worth every moment.", rating: 5 },

This park is much less touristy and busy than some of the surrounding national parks, but the views are just as amazing and honestly a better experience since you're not overcome by bus loads of tourists trying to get a picture at Moraine Lake.", rating: 5 },
